# video-use

Introducing **video-use** — edit videos with Claude Code. 100% open source.

Drop raw footage in a folder, chat with Claude Code, get `final.mp4` back. Works for any content — talking heads, montages, tutorials, travel, interviews — without presets or menus.

Try video-use in [Browser Use Cloud](https://cloud.browser-use.com/v4?utm_campaign=video-use-use-in-cloud&utm_source=github).

## What it does

- **Cuts out filler words** (`umm`, `uh`, false starts) and dead space between takes
- **Auto color grades** every segment (warm cinematic, neutral punch, or any custom ffmpeg chain)
- **30ms audio fades** at every cut so you never hear a pop
- **Burns subtitles** in your style — 2-word UPPERCASE chunks by default, fully customizable
- **Generates animation overlays** via [HyperFrames](https://github.com/heygen-com/hyperframes), [Remotion](https://www.remotion.dev/), [Manim](https://www.manim.community/), or PIL — spawned in parallel sub-agents, one per animation
- **Self-evaluates the rendered output** at every cut boundary before showing you anything
- **Persists session memory** in `project.md` so next week's session picks up where you left off

## Setup prompt

Paste into Claude Code, Codex, Hermes, Openclaw, or any agent with shell access:

```text
Set up the bundled video-use skill for the Automaton Command Center.

Read install.md first. Install the Python helpers, verify ffmpeg and ffprobe, register the complete skill directory with Hermes, and do not ask for or require an ElevenLabs API key. For subtitles, use the local ASR fallback described in references/local-asr-subtitles.md when needed. Then read SKILL.md and helpers/ for daily usage. After setup, wait for the user to provide footage; do not transcribe anything during installation.
```

For this project, ElevenLabs is deliberately deferred. The agent should never block footage inventory, visual review, editing, subtitles, or rendering on ElevenLabs. If local transcription is unavailable, explain the limitation honestly.

Then point your agent at a folder of raw takes:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/videos
claude    # or codex, hermes, etc.
```

For always-on editing from your own VPS or Telegram, run the agent through [Browser Use Box](https://browser-use.com/bux). [Watch the 15-second demo](https://www.tiktok.com/@browser_use/video/7639824093721758989).

And in the session:

> edit these into a launch video

It inventories the sources, proposes a strategy, waits for your OK, then produces `edit/final.mp4` next to your sources. All outputs live in `<videos_dir>/edit/` — the skill directory stays clean.

## Manual install

If you'd rather do it by hand:

```bash
# 1. Clone and symlink into your agent's skills directory
git clone https://github.com/browser-use/video-use ~/Developer/video-use
ln -sfn ~/Developer/video-use ~/.claude/skills/video-use        # Claude Code
# ln -sfn ~/Developer/video-use ~/.codex/skills/video-use       # Codex

# 2. Install deps
cd ~/Developer/video-use
uv sync                         # or: pip install -e .
brew install ffmpeg             # required
brew install yt-dlp             # optional, for downloading online sources

# 3. Optional local subtitle fallback
# ElevenLabs is not required for this project's workflow.
python -m pip install --user faster-whisper
```

For this project, use the local word-level ASR fallback when subtitles are needed. If it is unavailable, report the limitation rather than fabricating captions.

## How it works

The LLM never watches the video. It **reads** it — through two layers that together give it everything it needs to cut with word-boundary precision.

<p align="center">
  <img src="static/timeline-view.svg" alt="timeline_view composite — filmstrip + speaker track + waveform + word labels + silence-gap cut candidates" width="100%">
</p>

**Layer 1 — Audio transcript (always loaded).** One ElevenLabs Scribe call per source gives word-level timestamps, speaker diarization, and audio events (`(laughter)`, `(applause)`, `(sigh)`). All takes pack into a single ~12KB `takes_packed.md` — the LLM's primary reading view.

```
## C0103  (duration: 43.0s, 8 phrases)
  [002.52-005.36] S0 Ninety percent of what a web agent does is completely wasted.
  [006.08-006.74] S0 We fixed this.
```

**Layer 2 — Visual composite (on demand).** `timeline_view` produces a filmstrip + waveform + word labels PNG for any time range. Called only at decision points — ambiguous pauses, retake comparisons, cut-point sanity checks.

> Naive approach: 30,000 frames × 1,500 tokens = **45M tokens of noise**.
> Video Use: **12KB text + a handful of PNGs**.

Same idea as browser-use giving an LLM a structured DOM instead of a screenshot — but for video.

## Pipeline

```
Transcribe ──> Pack ──> LLM Reasons ──> EDL ──> Render ──> Self-Eval
                                                              │
                                                              └─ issue? fix + re-render (max 3)
```

The self-eval loop runs `timeline_view` on the _rendered output_ at every cut boundary — catches visual jumps, audio pops, hidden subtitles. You see the preview only after it passes.

## Design principles

1. **Text + on-demand visuals.** No frame-dumping. The transcript is the surface.
2. **Audio is primary, visuals follow.** Cuts come from speech boundaries and silence gaps.
3. **Ask → confirm → execute → self-eval → persist.** Never touch the cut without strategy approval.
4. **Zero assumptions about content type.** Look, ask, then edit.
5. **12 hard rules, artistic freedom elsewhere.** Production-correctness is non-negotiable. Taste isn't.

See [`SKILL.md`](./SKILL.md) for the full production rules and editing craft.
